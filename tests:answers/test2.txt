Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dyin'
And, my dear, we're still goodbyin'
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fire's glossy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow!
